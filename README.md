## crossbeam_pool

crossbeam_pool is a set of [crossbeam](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam) scoped threads.
It has been primarily developed to be used as a thread pool for [Terra](https://github.com/younisshah/terra)
to handle incoming Geofence WebSocket connections.

**This is a work in progress. Please standby!**
